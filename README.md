# Simple-JS-Pig-Game

A small video game project that I created as part of a learning course on Udemy. All UI and functionalities are written in bare JS, HTML and CSS code.

The game follows the same rules as the classic Pig Game: each player can roll a dice how many times they want during their turn, and the dice's value will add to the sum of their score.  However, if they roll a 1, then all their current sum will be reset to zero, and the turn will be switched to the second player. The current player that is rolling the dice can also choose to "hold", converting their current sum to their total sum, and ending their turn. The goal is to determine who gets to a certain score first; in the current repository, the goal score is set to 20.
